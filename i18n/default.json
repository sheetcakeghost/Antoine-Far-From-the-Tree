/*/ 8-Hearts ~ Fall /*/
"Antoine.Fall.8h.1": "Orange fruits and vegetables are so energetic. It's no wonder why so many oranges want to be orange instead of green.$h",
"Antoine.Fall.8h.2": "Do you think people are ants trying to understand math? Is it possible for people to really understand the full depths of reality? I wonder about that sometimes.$7",

"Antoine.Winter.10h.4": "I don't know if I'll still be aware after death, but I hope not. Imagine everything ending and still being aware for millions of years with nothing around you.$6",
"Antoine.Winter.10h.5": "Some days I feel like I'm just waiting for something, and I can't do anything else while I wait, but there's nothing that I'm actually waiting for. Rather than dwell on it I just look at memes on the Internet and hope I don't feel like that after a night's sleep. That helps reset my brain, I guess.$s",
"Antoine.Winter.10h.6": "Man, frozen meals are really depressing. I really should just make a whole bunch of stuff in fall to just reheat for the winter.$s",

"Antoine.PreFlower.10H.1": "The flower dance is going to be extra special tomorrow. I can't wait!",
"Antoine.PreLuau.10H.1": "I'm afraid to invite my family to the Luau. One time I attended it when I was in my old form and a kid tried to throw me into the pot!",

"Antoine.movies.5.before": "I, um, thanks for inviting me. I'll admit I'm a little nervous about this one.",
"Antoine.movies.5.during": "%Antione is tightly gripping his shirt.",//"Response": "like",

Note: These are just here so that you have them to refer to later when they become relevant. 

They're not meant to be added to alpha release.

I do intend to expand on them when we're actually working on animations.

/*/



/*/ Animation Strings /*/

/*/
//TOO BUSY FOR FARMER      //These are intended to be used with Antoine's casting and Headphones animations to indicate to the farmer that he either can't talk right now, or doesn't notice them.

	//Antoine Busy Casting
	"AnBusyCasting.01": "%Antoine smiles at you, but is too busy casting to speak to you right now.",

	//Antoine Listing to Headphones
	"AnGoodTunes.01": "%Antoine is too engrossed in his music to notice you.",


//LAPTOP COMMENTARY      //These would be in his laptop animation if you interact with Antoine while he's typing.

	//Cat Video "Flower Crashes Cat" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncNwe13rguE
	"AnAtlaptop.01": "Have you seen this video, @? A girl is singing a folk song to her cat, then puts a flower put on top of it's head and gets a look of existential dread, like it's seeing straight into the heart of the universe. It's pretty funny.$h",


//READING A BOOK        //When Antoine is chilling out and reading a book he would love to tell the Farmer all about what he's reading.

	//Generic Book
	"AnReadBook.01": "Hi, @. I'm sort of absorbed in this book here. I hope you don't mind.$0",
    "AnReadBook.02": "I'm reading a really interesting book on echolocation. Ha ha, it certainly explains why bats seem to speak so loudly.$h",
    "AnReadBook.03": "This book? It's about the pros and cons of syllabaries vs. alphabets vs. glyphs. Alphabets are quite limiting with roughly only 100 symbols to convey language, but syllabaries can have several hundreds more. It'd be quite intimidating to learn them all.$0",
    "AnReadBook.04": "Hmm? Oh, this is less of a book and more of an essay about why bicycles just never caught on in Stardew Valley$0",

    //Elliott's Book
    "AnReadElBook.01": "Oh, I'm reading %book. Elliott should be very proud of it, he's an exceptional writer.$0",

    //Rodney's Book
    "AnReadRBookDwarf.01": "Ah, this is the book Rodney wrote about, ah, I probably shouldn't say their name. I don't think he's knows it's about them anyway.$0",

    "AnReadRBookShadow.01": "This book is very ... well Rodney certainly has an interesting take on shadow folks.$h",


//TOO DAMN COLD

	//Antoine Busy Casting - Winter Edition
	"AnBusyCastingBrr.01": "%Antoine ignores you because he's is too busy casting to speak to you right now."
	
	//Antoine Listing to Headphones - Winter Edition
	"AnGoodTunesBrr.01": "%Antoine looks sort of miserable and definitely doesn't want to talk right now.",
